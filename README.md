Learning Objectives
* Practice setting up a React app
* Practice Mocking a React app
* Practice using and lifting state
* Practice rendering a list
* Practice conditional rendering

-----------------------------

## Prerequisites
* Introduction to React static components, mocking, state, rendering

## Getting Started
1. `mkdir groceriesHw`
2. `npx create-react-app react_groceries`
3. `cd react_groceries`

## Deliverables
Build a grocery app that allows users to make a grocery list

## Technical Requirements
1. Read over these specs and draw a mockup of your app (don't worry about bonus features at this point)
2. Must have grocery items in this shape

```
{
  item: '',
  brand '',
  units: '',
  quantity: 0,
  isPurchased: false
}
```
1. Make an array of 3 objects using the above shape and render the item, quantity and units (12 pack, 1lb, 2 liters, etc.)
2. Make inputs so that new items can be added
3. Conditionally render the grocery items based on whether or not they were purchased (ok to have hard coded values for isPurchased)
4. Add some style to your app
5. Stretch Add a button that says 'remove' and when clicked the value of `isPurchased` is toggled
